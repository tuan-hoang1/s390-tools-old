.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B lszcrypt
command is used to display information about cryptographic devices managed by
zcrypt and the AP bus attributes of zcrypt. Displayed information depends on the
kernel version.
.B lszcrypt
requires that sysfs is mounted.
.P
The following information can be displayed for each cryptographic
device: card ID, domain ID, card type (symbolic), mode, online status,
hardware card type (numeric), installed function facilities, card capability,
hardware queue depth, request count, number of requests in hardware queue, and
the number of outstanding requests.
The following AP bus attributes can be displayed: AP domain, Max AP domain,
configuration timer, poll thread status, poll timeout, and AP interrupt
status.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -V, --verbose
The verbose level for cryptographic device information.
With this verbose level additional information like hardware card type,
hardware queue depth, pending request queue count, outstanding
request queue count, and installed function facilities are displayed.
.TP 8
.B <device id>
Specifies a cryptographic device to display. A cryptographic device can be
either a card device or a queue device. If no devices are specified information
about all available devices is displayed.

Please note that the card device representation and the queue device are both
in hexadecimal notation.
.TP 8
.B -b, --bus
Displays the AP bus attributes and exits.
.TP 8
.B -c, --capability <device id>
Shows the capabilities of a cryptographic device of hardware type 6 or
higher. The device id value may be given as decimal or hex value (with
a leading 0x). The capabilities of a cryptographic device depend on the
card type and the installed function facilities. A cryptographic device
can provide one or more of the following capabilities:
.RS
.IP "o" 3
RSA 2K Clear Key
.IP "o"
RSA 4K Clear Key
.IP "o"
CCA Secure Key
.IP "o"
EP11 Secure Key
.IP "o"
Long RNG
.RE
.TP 8
.B -d, --domains
Shows the usage and control domains of the cryptographic devices.
The displayed domains of the cryptographic device depends on the initial
cryptographic configuration.
.RS
.IP "o" 2
 'C' indicate a control domain
.IP "o"
 'U' indicate a usage domain
.IP "o"
 'B' indicate both (control and usage domain)
.RE
.TP 8
.B -h, --help
Displays help text and exits.
.TP 8
.B -v, --version
Displays version information and exits.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
