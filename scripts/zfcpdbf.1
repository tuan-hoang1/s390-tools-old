.SH NAME
zfcpdbf \- zfcp trace data sort/analyse tool.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
\fBzfcpdbf\fR [OPTIONS] <adapter>
.br
\fBzfcpdbf\fR {-h|-v}

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBzfcpdbf\fR Interprets the information from various logging and tracing sources,
e.g. zfcp-, qdio- and cio-trace records and, if available, system messages.

With offline debug data, such as collected by \fBdbginfo.sh\fR or
extracted from a Linux system dump with \fBcrash\fR version 5.1.0 or
later, zfcpdbf can run on any platform with a suitable Perl language
environment.

Any zfcpdbf since version 1.13.0 works with debug data from any Linux
kernel since version 2.6.38. Recent zfcpdbf versions with older kernel
versions show zeros or empty values for newer trace record fields the
old kernel did not yet have. Older zfcpdbf versions with recent kernel
versions simply show the old trace records fields zfcpdbf already
knows about and ignores any newer trace record fields of the kernel.
For full exploitation, it is recommended to always use the latest
version of zfcpdbf no matter from which kernel version the debug data is.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
\fB-x <AREA[,AREA]>\fR, \fB--exclude=<AREA[,AREA]>\fR
list of trace areas to exclude (default none).

.TP
\fB-i <AREA[,AREA]>\fR, \fB--include=<AREA[,AREA]>\fR
list of trace areas to include (default all).

.TP
\fB-z \fR, \fB--zfcp-only\fR
zfcp trace areas only (short cut).

.TP
\fB-t <DIFF>\fR, \fB--timediff=<DIFF>\fR
highlight requests with a round-trip processing time of <DIFF> or more.

.TP
\fB-e\fR, \fB--def-error\fR
do NOT show deferred error messages.

.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--force\fR
force execution on a detected version mismatch.

.TP
\fB-p <PATH>\fR, \fB--path=<PATH>\fR
use directory <PATH> for the location of the trace records.

.TP
\fB-r <PATH>\fR, \fB--root=<PATH>\fR
prepend <ROOT> to standard trace record location.

.TP
\fB-m <ZONE>\fR, \fB--timezone=<ZONE>\fR
set time zone for system message timestamps.

.SH PARAMETERS
<AREA> may be REC, HBA, SAN, SCSI, QDIO, QDIO_SETUP, QDIO_ERROR,
CIO_TRACE, CIO_MSG, CIO_CRW, KERNEL or MULTIPATH.

<DIFF> is the value in seconds which has to be lapsed between sending the request
and receiving its response.

<PATH> is specifying the location(directory) of trace records which were pulled
from another system, e.g. pulled from a dump.

<ROOT> is specifying a directory which has to be prepended to the standard
location of the trace records, e.g. typically used in conjunction with
the result of the dbginfo script.

<PATH> and <ROOT> are only useful if used on non-live systems and therefore
typically used by service- or development-staff.

<ZONE> is a time zone value in the [+-][h]h[:mm] format.

<adapter> aka busid is specifying the host adapter of which the trace information should be processed. if a 4-digit value is provided it is automaitically extended to the correct format 0f 0.0.xxxx.
